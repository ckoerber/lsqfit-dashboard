## How to contribute

For now the project is in the brainstorming phase and we are looking forward to receive opinions.
Feel free to take a look at the issues and create your own or reply to present issues.

A good point for starting is the [project ideas collection](https://github.com/ckoerber/lsqfit-dashboard/projects/1).

## Creating issues

If you request a new feature, please try to

- emphasize the need and benefit
- explain how this request might look like if implemented (examples)
- if possible, propose ideas of how to implement such a feature
